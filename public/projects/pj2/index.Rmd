# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{R}
approval_week <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate),
         week = week(enddate),
         year = year(enddate), year = as.character(year),
         net_approval = approve - disapprove) %>%
  group_by(week, year) %>%
  summarise(net_approval_mean = mean(net_approval), count = n(), standev = sd(net_approval)) %>%
  mutate(confint_parameter = 1.96 * (standev)/sqrt(count)) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound = net_approval_mean - confint_parameter)  %>%
  mutate(upper_bound = net_approval_mean + confint_parameter) 

approval_week %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = net_approval_mean)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound , ymax = upper_bound, fill = year)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("indianred1", "green3", "turquoise3", "orchid"))   +
  geom_point(size=0.6) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept= 0, color = "orange") +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20.0,7.5,2.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,52,13)) +
  labs(title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls", x = "Week of the year", y="Average Net Approval (%)") + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 7, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6), axis.title.x = element_text(size = 6), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 6))

```

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

In week 15, the confidence bands are tighter than in week 34. This could be attributed to a higher degree of uncertainty in week 34, implying that voters have an increasingly polarising opinion of Donald Trump.
