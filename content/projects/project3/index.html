<div id="Changes in GDP components" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes in GDP components</h1>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a>.</p>

                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and we must make it into long, tidy format. We shall express all figures in billions (divide values by <code>1e9</code>, or <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span>), and we want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in our dataframe, let us calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the % difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling us? Can we explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of government expenditure, Germany and United States have been spending more than India, as a proportion of their respective GDPs. This could be attributed to Germany and United States being wealthier countries than India, with governments that have a deeper coffer as well as the ability to raise more debt.</p>
<p>We can also see an increase in gross capital formation in India, in the years after 2000, while the same levels are observed for Germany and United States. This could be interpreted as India accelerating its growth, to catch up to the more developed countries like Germany and United States.</p>
<p>The one factor that is consistent across all three countries is that household expenditure always comprises the biggest proportion of GDP, with consumers’ spending being a key driver of any economy.</p>
