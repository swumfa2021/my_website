# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:


```{r}
skim(yrbss)
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
skim(yrbss$weight)
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x=weight)) + geom_histogram()
```

*ANSWER:* There are 1004 observations missing weights. The distribution is right skewed, there is a higher concentration of participants with lower weight. We suspect people who wheigh more do not feel comfortable sharing that information. 

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss2 <- yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(totalcount = sum(count))

yrbss2

ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = physical_3plus)) + geom_bar()

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?
```{r}
yrbss2 <- yrbss2 %>%
slice_min(order_by = prop) %>%
  mutate(sderror = sqrt((prop*(1-prop))/totalcount),
         upper_limit = prop + 1.96*sderror, 
         lower_limit = prop - 1.96*sderror)
yrbss2
```
*ANSWER:* The upper limit of the confidence interval is c. 0.339 and the lower limit is c. 0.323. 

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x= "Did you exercise in the last 3 days?")

```

*ANSWER:* We see an inverse relation between being active and weight. This is the opposite of what we expected. One way to explain this could be that people who answered no are leaner than people who do exercise (answered yes) and have less muscle. 
This reinforces our hypothesis: people who do not answer either weight or whether they have exercised are on the heavier side. NOte we cannot draw this conclusion at this point, it will need more research.


## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

*ANSWER:* H0 is that there is no difference in the mean weights of those who exercise and those wo do not.
          Ha is that there is a difference in these mean weights. 

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

*ANSWER:* The T test shows us that there is sufficient evidence to reject H0. We drew the same conclusion from the fact that the confidence intervals did not overlap.

## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

*ANSWER:* H0 there is no difference in the mean IMDB-rating for movies produced by Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton. 
          Ha There is a significant difference between these mean IMDB-ratings.

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
movies1 <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating= mean(rating), 
            count = n(),
            sderror = sd(rating)/sqrt(count-1)) %>%
  mutate(upper_limit = avg_rating + 1.96*sderror,
         lower_limit = avg_rating - 1.96*sderror) %>%
  arrange(avg_rating)

ggplot(movies1, mapping=aes(
  x = avg_rating,
  y= reorder(director, avg_rating), 
  colour = director)) + geom_errorbarh(

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination
```{r}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
  omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            sd_salary = sd(salary),
            sample_size=n(),
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
            t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            se_salary=(sd(salary)/sqrt(sample_size)),
            margin_se=t_critical*se_salary,
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval
            salary_low=mean_salary-margin_se,
            salary_high=mean_salary+margin_se)

```

> From the summary table, we see that the average, median, min, max and quantile salary results all points to male executives having higher salaries than female ones. Therefore, according to the summary data, it is likely that male executives have significantly higher salary than females ones. From the second data frame, we can see that the 95% CI of male and female executive salaries do not overlap with each other. This indicates that male executives indeed have higher salaries.

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender,data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1212)
salary_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  #specify the variable of interest
  specify(salary~gender) %>% 
  #Hypothesize a null of no difference
  hypothesise(null="independence") %>% 
  #Generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>% 
  #Find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat="diff in means",
            order = c("female","male"))

#Visualize data and check where the observed sample difference '-8700' falls
salary_in_null_world %>% visualize() + 
  shade_ci(endpoints=c(-Inf,-8700),fill = "khaki")+
  labs(title='Difference in Female and Male Employee Salary 
in a world where there is  really no difference',
       subtitle = 'Observed difference marked in green',
        y='Count',
        x='Average Female-Average Male'
      )+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

#Calculate a p-value, or the probability that we would see the green line at

salary_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = -8700,direction = "both")


```


> From t-test, we can see that the 95% CI range is negative and does not include zero.The p-value 2e-4 is also very small. This indicates that male excutives indeed have higher salaries. With the simulation method, we can see from the plot that the observed difference falls in the far left of the plot. We also calculated a p-value of 0.002, which is again very small. This result indicates that male excutives indeed have higher salaries as well.


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  
```{r}

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_experience = mean(experience),
            sd_experience = sd(experience),
            sample_size=n(),
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
            t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            se_experience=(sd(experience)/sqrt(sample_size)),
            margin_se=t_critical*se_experience,
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval
            experience_low=mean_experience-margin_se,
            experience_high=mean_experience+margin_se)

```
> From the summary table, we see that the average, median, min, max and quantile experience results all points to male executives having more experience than female ones. Therefore, according to the summary data, it is likely that male executives have significantly more experience than females ones. From the second data frame, we can see that the 95% CI of male and female executive experience do not overlap with each other. This indicates that male executives indeed have more experience.

```{r}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience~gender,data=omega)


# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1212)
experience_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  #specify the variable of interest
  specify(experience~gender) %>% 
  #Hypothesize a null of no difference
  hypothesise(null="independence") %>% 
  #Generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>% 
  #Find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat="diff in means",
            order = c("female","male"))

#Visualize data and check where the observed sample difference falls
obs_diff_exp=7.38-21.12
experience_in_null_world %>% visualize() + 
  shade_ci(endpoints=c(-Inf,obs_diff_exp),fill = "khaki")+
  labs(title='Difference in Female and Male Employee Experience
in a world where there is  really no difference',
       subtitle = 'Observed difference marked in green',
        y='Count',
        x='Average Female-Average Male')+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

#Calculate a p-value, or the probability that we would see the green line at
experience_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = obs_diff_exp,direction = "both")

```

> From t-test, we can see that the 95% CI range is negative and does not include zero.The p-value 1e-05 is also very small. This indicates that male excutives indeed have more experience. With the simulation method, we can see from the plot that the observed difference falls in the far left of the plot. We also calculated a p-value of almost zero, which is again very small. This result indicates that male excutives indeed have more experience as well. 
The result male executives having more experience endangers the previous result - male executives have higher salaries. For now it is possible that the salary differences result from experience gap instead gender difference.

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
#correlation test between salary and experience
cor.test(omega$salary,omega$experience,method="pearson")

#visualize the data
library(ggpubr)
ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,y=salary))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Experience/Year(s)",y="Salary/Dollars")+
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method="lm",se=TRUE,color="darkblue")+
  stat_cor(method = "pearson")

```

>There is an obvious positive correlation between experience and salary, with the correlation value as high as 0.8. The degree of freedom is 48 and p-value is 2.257e-12 < 0.05(the p-value under df=48).Thus, the correlation between the two variables is significant. 

## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```


>The group of females as a whole has less experience in work compared to the group of males. And there exists a significant positive correlation between experience  and salary both in females and males. Thus, the gap between avarage salary of males and females is mostly caused by the experience difference group.
From the scatterplot, we can see that females with similar experience to males tend to have similar salaries either. We can infer that discrimination is not the major, at least not only factor, that results in the salary difference in the two groups.

# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/).

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

*Answer:* In the last graph we made, we observe that the yield for 3 month treasury bills has surpassed the yield for 10- year treasury notes only 3 times between 1999 and 2020. Note that this event indicates an inverse yield curve and is therefore preceded by the yield curve flattening. The two recessions in 2001 and 2007-2009 were clearly preceded by the flattening of the yieldcurve. The most recent time this flattening happenned was in 2019, as you are well aware, this was also followed by a recession. This final observation would indicate that investors anticipated the current recession, be it not in its current form. 
Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- To colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`.

```{r final graph}

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = "year", values_to = "Expenditure") %>%mutate(Expenditure = Expenditure/(10^9))
  

clean_GDP_Data <- tidy_GDP_data%>%
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
      IndicatorName == "Final consumption expenditure" ~ "Total Consumption", 
      IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household Consumption", 
      IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Gov Consumption", 
      IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross Capital Formation",   
      IndicatorName == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)" ~ "Gross Capital", 
      IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports", 
      IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports", 
      IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP", 
      IndicatorName == "Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)" ~ "Ag/Hunt/Forest/Fish", 
      IndicatorName == "Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities (ISIC C-E)" ~ "Min/Manu/Utility",
      IndicatorName == "Manufacturing (ISIC D)" ~ "Manufacturing",
      IndicatorName == "Construction (ISIC F)" ~ "Construction",
      IndicatorName == "Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)" ~ "Wholesale/Retail/Hospitality",
      IndicatorName == "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)" ~ "Transport/Comm/Storage",
      IndicatorName == "Other Activities (ISIC J-P)" ~ "Other",
      IndicatorName == "Total Value Added" ~ "Total Value Added",
      IndicatorName == "Changes in inventories" ~ "Changes in inventories"))

clean_GDP_Data

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)

US_India_Germany_GDP <- clean_GDP_Data%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  select(Country, IndicatorName, year, Expenditure)%>%
  filter(Country %in% c("United States","India","Germany"))%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c("Gross Capital Formation", "Exports","Gov Consumption", "Household Consumption", "Imports" ))


ggplot(US_India_Germany_GDP, aes(year, Expenditure, colour = IndicatorName, group = IndicatorName)) + geom_line() + labs (title = "GDP components over time", subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD", y = "Billions US$", x = "") + theme_bw(base_size = 10) + scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) + facet_wrap(~Country) + guides(color=guide_legend("Components of GDP")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
  
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}
GDP_Calculation <- clean_GDP_Data %>%
  filter(IndicatorName == "Household Consumption" | IndicatorName == "Gross Capital Formation" | IndicatorName == "Gov Consumption" | IndicatorName == "Exports" | IndicatorName == "Imports" | IndicatorName == "GDP")

GDP_Calculation <-  spread(GDP_Calculation, IndicatorName, Expenditure)

GDP_Calculation <- GDP_Calculation %>%
  mutate(Calculated_GDP = `Household Consumption`+`Gross Capital Formation`+`Gov Consumption`+Exports-Imports)

GDP_Calculation <- GDP_Calculation %>%
  mutate(Percentage_Difference = (Calculated_GDP - GDP)/GDP)
```

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```



> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

#Answer: 

In terms of government expenditure, Germany and United States have been spending more than India, as a proportion of their respective GDPs. This could be attributed to Germany and United States being wealthier countries than India, with governments that have a deeper coffer as well as the ability to raise more debt.

We can also see an increase in gross capital formation in India, in the years after 2000, while the same levels are observed for Germany and United States. This could be interpreted as India accelerating its growth, to catch up to the more developed countries like Germany and United States.

The one factor that is consistent across all three countries is that household expenditure always comprises the biggest proportion of GDP, with consumers' spending being a key driver of any economy.

> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like
